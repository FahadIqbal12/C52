    If you’d like to help us out and get something in return then consider purchasing our brand new book Everyone Can Learn Origami. You’ll get a massive 300+ page book that’s perfect for origami beginners. It teaches all the basics and then has incredibly detailed instructions for 77 traditional origami models.
    One of the absolute best things you can do to help us out is post a link to our site on your own website or blog. Feel free to link to our home page, diagram database or your favourite post. This is extremely helpful for helping new people find our site.
    Origami-Shop.com is probably the best online origami store with books, papers and other items you can’t find anywhere else. Just like Amazon if you click through the link below and make a purchase they’ll know you came from us and give us a small commission. It costs you nothing and is another excellent way to support the site from buying items you would have bought anyways.
